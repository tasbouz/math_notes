My notes on various topics of mathematics.

## - Part 1: Fundamental Mathematics

For the first part of my notes on "Fundamental Mathematics" I have used the amazing notes of [sreahw](https://github.com/sreahw) that you can find [here](https://github.com/sreahw/schuller-geometric), and [here](https://github.com/sreahw/Lecture_Notes_GR), and I arranged the code to fit my needs. I strongly advise you  to visit the actual notes since they are more complete, more detailed, and more in order with the lectures:

* [Geometrical Anatomy of Theoretical Physics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPH7f_7ZlzxTi6kS4vCmv4ZKm9u8g5yic)
* [International Winter School on Gravity and Light 2015](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFeEvEPtX_0S6vxxiiNPrJbLu9aK1UVC_)

## - Part 2: Probability Theory & Statistics
*Work In Progress...*

For the second part on "Probability Theory & Statistics" the notes are based on a collection of various books I read, and lectures I watched and found useful.

Some of the books are the following:
* [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/148009.The_Elements_of_Statistical_Learning)

Some of the lectures are the following:
* [Statistics 110: Probability](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2SOU6wwxB0uwwH80KTQ6ht66KWxbzTIo)
* [Statistics for Applications](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP60uVBMaoNERc6knT_MgPKS0)
